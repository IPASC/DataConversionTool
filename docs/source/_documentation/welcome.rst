Welcome to IPASC Data Conversion Tool's documentation!
======================================================

The photoacoustic data landscape is very heterogeneous, which can lead to problems in the exchange of
photoacoustic images. Essentially, each vendor of photoacoustic devices has developed their own
sophisticated data format that suffices their own needs.

While this is a very natural process it leads to two distinct problems:

1. Dependency on vendor-specific data access software to interpret recorded images.
2. Different definitions for similarly named fields

To this end, the Data Acquisition and Management thematic working group of IPASC has developed a standardised list
of metadata parameters and published a corresponding document on their website in early 2020:
:download:`IPASC Metadata definitions <https://www.ipasc.science/documents/20200121_Metadata_list.pdf>`. This tool
is based on the definitions contained in this document and is supposed to form the basis for a facilitated exchange of
photoacoustic data.
